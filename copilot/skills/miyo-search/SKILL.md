# Miyo vault search

Search the user's indexed Obsidian vault through Miyo, the user's own companion
app for semantic search over their notes. It finds relevant notes by meaning
(not just filename). Searches go only to the user's own Miyo service — the local
app by default, or the remote Miyo server they configured in settings — never a
third-party API, and no API key.

When to use it: for any vault-search intent, reach for Miyo when your builtin
`grep` search is too slow or doesn't surface enough relevant notes, or when
the user explicitly asks for Miyo search.

## How to run

Find the absolute path to this SKILL.md file on disk, then run the script next
to it that matches the operating system, passing the user's full question as the
query. No extra runtime is needed — `sh` (macOS/Linux) and `cmd` (Windows) are
always present.

On macOS or Linux:

```bash
sh "/absolute/path/to/this/skill/directory/miyo-search.sh" "<the user's question>"
```

On Windows, run the `.cmd` wrapper. In PowerShell you must prefix it with the
call operator `&` (PowerShell treats a quoted path on its own as a string and
won't run it); from cmd, run the quoted path without the `&`:

```powershell
& "/absolute/path/to/this/skill/directory/miyo-search.cmd" "<the user's question>"
```

The script locates the Miyo binary itself and prints JSON to stdout — you do
not need to know where Miyo is installed or which shell you are in. Run the
script as your single search step; do not fall back to other search tools
unless it reports that Miyo is unavailable. Read the JSON straight from stdout;
do not pipe it through other tools (no `jq`, no `|`).

Search scope comes from Copilot settings. **Current vault** applies Miyo's exact
folder boundary for the active vault, including from Project chats.
**Unrestricted** searches every folder registered with Miyo.

## Reading the results

The script prints `{ "results": [ { "path": ..., "content": ... } ], "count": N }`.
Cite the `path` of any note you use so the user can open it.

## If it reports a problem

The script exits with a clear message when Miyo can't be used:

- **Not installed** (CLI not found): the Miyo desktop app isn't installed on
  this machine. Tell the user to install and open Miyo, then try again. Do not
  retry in a loop.
- **Not running** (search failed / can't reach the service): the app is
  installed but not running. Tell the user to open Miyo, then continue without
  vault search if they can't.
